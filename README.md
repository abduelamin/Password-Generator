# Password-Generator

This repository is my first project whereby I incorporate HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a functional password generator.

## Introduction

Hello there, In this project, I showcase my understanding of data structures and algorithms and how data can be manipulated in various ways to give the user a random password each time tailored to their specific needs. I learned many important things from building this project, the most important of all is the flexibility of Javascript and how you can intertwine different techniques to achieve an end product.
